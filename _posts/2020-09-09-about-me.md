Hallo, Ich heiße Colin Lowrance and I am Marketing major and German minor as you could have noticed. This is my senior year at CNU, but my education is not going to end after this year; I am currently researching finance graduate programs to apply for this coming year. Having a master’s degree will help prepare me to become a [commercial real estate broker](https://southgaterealtyllc.com/blog/what-does-a-commercial-broker-do/). 

During the summer I focused on my research grant paper, which I study how COVID-19 has affected business operations in commercial real estate. The research has helped me understand more of what goes on in the commercial real estate industry, making me prepared to enter with knowledge that is beyond other new salespersons. In late August I was also a member of the Smart Smiles 5K race committee that is hosted by the Boys and Girls Club. Over the past three years I have volunteered at some of the events the Boys and Girls Club host.   

Outside of school most of my time is spent training for triathlons, specifically [Ironman 70.3 triathlons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3), training ranges from 10 to 15 hours a week. I am also a part of a triathlon team based out of Bath U.K. called “t3”. Over the summer I also bought a new bike that is specific to triathlon, I still look at it like a kid opening their Christmas presents. I have a long term goal of qualifying for the Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii (similar to qualifying for the Boston marathon).

I don’t just enjoy constantly training, with my other free time I like to play video games like [The Last of Us Part 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II) which I just finished. Lastly like the majority of other people I like spending time with my friends and family.

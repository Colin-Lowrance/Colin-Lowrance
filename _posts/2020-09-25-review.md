  The Mapping Inequality project shows maps of cities created by Home Owners’ Loan Corporation(HOLC) from 1935 to 1940. These maps divided the cities up into sections based on the “mortgage security’ quality of areas. These different sections had ratings from A (green) through D(Red), A being the best possible and D the worst. While this seems legal, the decisions that affected the “quality” were based on race. “HOLC assumed and insisted that the residency of African Americans and immigrants, as well as working-class whites, compromised the values of homes and the security of mortgages.” (Mapping Inequality) The project includes over 200 cities from the HOLC with a description describing the cities’ sections. As it sounds this project was a massive undertaking. Three teams from four different universities worked together. (University of Richmond, Virginia Tech, University of Maryland, and John Hopkins)

  The Downloads and Data tab shows users of the website how to cite the project, along with how to link specific cities. This page gives links to the Shapefile and GeoJSON, the software they used to create the interactive map, this opens the door to the viewer to create their own DH projects. While the software is linked in the tab helping viewers find it, having an explanation on how it was used, would expand the audience more. It also has a link to the data from the HOLC allowing viewers to use the data for their own.  The link also provides the terms and conditions of the data, making it simple for people to share or transform the data legally.

  When looking at the map of the U.S. it is daunting because of the mere size of the map. The search function of the map allows people to not be overwhelmed. The ability to search your local city can grab the attention of a new audience through something familiar. Interacting with the map can be finicky at times, if you zoom in too far on a city the ability to select the sections go away. This is not a major issue, a change to this could improve the “quality of life” of the project.         

  Diving into the introduction page of the website, it gives a wealth of information. Here the creators showed how much research they put into the project. They outline what were the causes that lead to the beginning of redlining in the 1930’s and 40’s  America. While this information is invaluable to understanding the project, the amount they have on one page is hard to absorb. Changing the interface of the introduction page by splitting the sections apart, would improve the chance of viewers consuming all the information and not burning out.  

  Mapping Inequalities in America is a project that shows us that racism is not as clear as grade school history classes taught us. The teams that brought the data and research together should be commended, the website provides free education on an understudied topic to students and others. Besides the minor hiccups with quality of life issues and setting up the introductions page differently; the project could reach a wider range of audience, introducing them to the power of Digital Humanities.

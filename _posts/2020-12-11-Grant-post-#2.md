## Grand Post 2
When looking back to the last blog post my overall grant packet has not changed much. To be completely honest I haven’t worked much on the grant since that blog post. I have had other work for classes that came up and took my attention away from the grant. I plan on turning my focus to cleaning up my Grant Narrative, CV, and Environmental scan. This means looking through all my peer reviews and trying to implement the comments that were made. I will also refer to the rubrics and guidelines that are on the course website which Dr. Stover has provided. 

Turning towards the budget, I need to do more research in this area as it is currently sitting at 320 dollars as the total budget cost, which is way under the 1,500 dollar limit. The costs I have included so far are website hosting and domain name, as well as some books needed to complete my background research on my topic. That being said, I think I may need to set up a meeting with Dr. Stover to talk about possible costs. I have a feeling that there are things that I will need, but can not think of by myself. I always find that when talking with others it can help stimulate my own thoughts and topics I didn’t notice before.

At the moment I do not think I will be including an appendix as a part of my grant packet. I never came up with any mock-up of what my project could look like. If allowed I would put examples of other projects that gave me inspiration. A possible example would be the “Redlining in America” mapping project. I have mentioned this project time and time again because I enjoy the way the information was displayed. This example laid the foundation of what I envision for my DH project. 

When thinking about actually making this idea a reality, I remind myself that I have no experience using Omeka and Neatline. I would need to take time to learn the basic fundamental functions and tools of the platform. Then learn how to tailor that to my idea of mapping Germany. I would be starting from ground zero. Working on pitching this idea is completely different from actually carrying out the project. I would be interested to see how long it would take for me to make this idea a real DH project. 

I look back on the beginning of this assignment and I felt like it was going to be more hands-on with the actual grant project (so creating the project). Now I know that it is more theory based/ getting the approval for the grant money (in other words getting the green light). That being said this assignment was extremely beneficial since you cannot make a DH project work without the grant money; so knowing how to win the grant is the most important step.  

This being the last blog post of the semester, I wanted to briefly talk about my experience while doing these assignments. I really enjoyed them which is not what I expected when starting this class. I know that no one reads this besides Dr. Stover but it feels like I am building something with this blog, oddly enough. I am going to miss doing these assignments and going to class.

# Grant Post 1
To reintroduce my grant project, I want to create a digital map of Germany prior to their unification in 1871 versus after the unification. Each map will contain information on each state and how the unification affected citizens and government of specific areas.

Past research has focused on learning more about the history of Germany through the 1700's and 1800’s leading into the unification of Germany. This part of the research is the base to the project, having correct information about the topic you are covering is the first and most important aspect of the project. Anyone can create a great digital humanities project but have incorrect information making the project completely useless. A major purpose of digital humanity projects is to educate the masses, hence explaining the importance of this first round of research

The next step in the research phase is to look more into how this project can be visualized. Analyzing which software best fits the goals of this project would allow me to make a quality map and timeline I feel is appropriate for the material found. Currently I have looked into Neatline as a way to visualize unified Germany and ununified Germany. That being said there are many other softwares that could get the job done, it just means sitting down and taking the time to understand how each program could make my ideas come to life.

When looking back at the start of my project, I was looking into making a digital edition of a H.G. Wells’ novel, “The Time Machine.” After thinking through the idea I could not come up with a strong reason for why this project needed to be made besides personal reasons. When switching to the idea of mapping Germany avenues opened up I had a purpose— education. I started with the idea of only mapping Germany that led to the idea of providing information about before and after unification of each state. This project has continued to show me different aspects of history that I could show to my audience and viewers. A grant proposal with more potential will always win against an idea that cannot be improved upon.

Referencing other projects has helped create my own idea of how I want my project to look. Redlining in America is one that I have continually gone back to reference, solely based on its effectiveness. The essence of the project was that it showed how America in the “New Deal” era was sectioned by Redlining. When looking at this project I want to use the idea of being able to see an overview of a country and then go further into map (cities and states) to get more information. I want to improve upon this idea through better organization, since in the Redlining project it can get a bit confusing with the different areas you can see.

Going forward I will continue my research into finding mapping software that helps me achieve my goals with this project, as well as finishing my research into the history of Germany’s unification. Working with the ideas presented in the Redlining in America DH project I hope to create a DH project that pushes the standard of what a great digital mapping project contains.

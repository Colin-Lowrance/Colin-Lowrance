Last week of class for English 350 was all focused on Text Encoding Initiative, tei for Short. TEI is a style of eXtensible Markup Language(XML) which is a way to encode a document that is both human readable and machine readable. To help understand TEI better, we were given a project that made us use TEI. The entire class needed to read the short story [“The Yellow Wall-paper”](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/theliteratureofprescription/exhibitionAssets/digitalDocs/The-Yellow-Wall-Paper.pdf) by [Charlotte Perkins Stetson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Perkins_Gilman); once finished each student was given a page or column to be carefully reviewed. This led us to mark up the given column using TEI through a platform called Oxygen. I was given page 650 column 1. We were not just thrown into Oxygen head on, we took baby steps to make sure each person was not overwhelmed by the scary looking format of TEI. Throughout this blog I will elaborate on each step that brought me to the final product in Oxygen, as well as my experience with using the platform for the first time.  

Before I started anything on Oxygen I needed to review the page and column I was given. I had a Google document open with the passage and then the original page in the pdf. I read between the google doc and the pdf to make sure everything was the same, while this seems pretty straight forward it took a little time switching between the files. Once I made sure everything was correct, I made mockup TEI code using the comment function to outline the document by pointing out each new paragraph, em dashes, page beginning, which column it was, and any mistakes the author had made. The mockup of TEI in Google docs helped introduce me to the purpose of TEI but in a formant that I am familiar with.

Leaning on the work I had done in Google docs I began to attempt my TEI in Oxygen. Oxygen felt familiar for some reason, at first I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I realized it was a similar format to a statistical analysis program R. The similarity in format design dissolved any fear I had in working with Oxygen. The class day going over how Oxygen works and common code needed for the project put the nail in the coffin. Using the knowledge from class and the confidence from R, I quickly wrote the code for my portion of the short story. I also want to point out that I would argue that had one of the easier passages to write code, making the process even simpler. I finished the TEI thinking it was so easy, I must have forgotten something. This worry went away on the troubleshoot day when I saw other student’s code which were similar to mine.

Working with new programs can be a nightmare for most people including me, this was not the case for me with Oxygen. The foundation that was laid out in the classes prior, made capable and confident in this new program. I was super interested in how coding is used for different purposes from what I previously had known. This project gave me a hands on experience into how some digital humanities projects are brought to life.
